# Task Board App

This is a personal task board application, inspired by tools like Trello, designed to help you organize your tasks and projects visually. You can create boards, add columns, and manage cards with details like priority, due dates, and assigned users.

## âœ¨ Features

  * **Board Management:** Create, view, and manage multiple task boards.
  * **Column Organization:** Add, edit, and delete columns within each board to define stages of your workflow.
  * **Card Details:** Create tasks as cards with properties like title, description, creator, assigned user, priority (Low, Medium, High), and due date.
  * **Drag-and-Drop (Planned/Future):** Seamlessly move cards between columns to update their status.
  * **Data Persistence:** Your boards, columns, and cards are saved locally in your browser using Zustand with local storage, so your data persists even if you close the tab.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), making it easy to set up and run.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

  * **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gsparsh17/Task_Board
    cd task-board-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## ðŸ’» Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and you'll see any lint errors directly in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for efficient caching. Your app is now ready to be deployed\! For more information, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back\!**

If you're not satisfied with the default build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This gives you full control, allowing you to tweak settings as needed. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they'll point to the copied scripts.

You don't ever have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready.
